# **SLACK STANDUP API**

This is the backend for the Lambda Labs 12 project [Stand-Em-Ups](www.stand-em-ups.com). The product runs aysnchronous standup meetings for teams via a web app or Slack. Managers can create teams and customize reports which are comprised of a set of questions and schedule. Those questions are delivered to team members on the schedule determined by the manager. Team members respond in the app or via a Slack DM. Responses are then displayed for the entire team to see.

# Third Party Integrations

## Authentication and User Management

Authentication is handled via Firebase Auth, which is implemented in the `/controllers/auth.js` using a JSON object provided by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth/) in the management console and customized here with environment variables. A user will sign up or log in via a Firebase component on the front end, which then makes a post call to our Firebase endpoint, delivering an access token in the request body. The endpoint verifies the token using a Firebase `auth` method, then checks the users table. If the user exists, we generate a JWT using a helper found in `/helpers/generateToken.js`, and send it back to the client with a `201` status. If the user does not exist, we insert it into the `Users` table, generate a token, and send the token back with another `201` status. 

## Slack

The [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/start/building) allows for users to recieve reports via DM and respond in kind. That being the case, information needs to be sent from the database `to` an incoming webhook created in the Slack App dashboard. Requests coming `from` Slack are sent to 

## SendGrid

[SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) allows for Admin users to send email invites to their team members with customized Join Codes. We have installed the SendGrid library, which allows us to collect information on the front end, post it to and endpoint, and call a SendGrid method on it to distribute emails. Note - Outlook users currently do not receive emails sent via Sendgrid. 

# SUMMARY TABLE OF API ENDPOINTS

Aside from `auth/firebase` all requests must be made with a header that includes the JWT returned from the POST request. The header serves several purposes, among them authentication and request specificity (many requests read the user's ID from decoded token). Additionally, requests made to routes protected by the admin validation middleware must include a token from a user whose role is `admin`. Request headers must be formatted as such:

| name            | type   | required | description              |
| --------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------ |
| `Content-Type`  | String | Yes      | 'application/JSON'       |
| `Authorization` | String | Yes      | JSON Web Token           |

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

For local development, save a .env file in the root directory with the following information. To deploy, be sure to adjust the service's environment variables accordingly (DB Host through Port are specific to local environments, hosting servce will provde you with the appropriate postgreSQL settings):

* DB_HOST = your local host

* DB_USER = your db username
* DB_PASS = your db password
* PORT = your port
* SENTRY_DSN = your sentry dsn key (get from sentry.io website)
* JWT_SECRET = put in whatever secret you want here
* PROJECT_ID = project id from Firebase console
* PRIVATE_KEY_ID = private key id from Firebase console
* PRIVATE_KEY = private key from Firebase console
* CLIENT_EMAIL = client email from Firebase console
* CLIENT_ID = client id from Firebase console
* CLIENT_URL = client url from Firebase console
* SLACK_CLIENT_ID = Client id from Slack API console
* SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET = Client Secret from Slack API console
* SLACK_REDIRECT_URI = Slack redirect URI set to local host auth route for dev and deplyed auth route in deployed
* SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET = in Basic information section on Slack API
* SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN = bot token from Slack OAuth section
